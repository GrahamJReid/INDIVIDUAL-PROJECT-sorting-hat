OVERVIEW: This project will allow users to sort themselves into the fictional houses of Hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry from the popular Harry Potter series. 
It will implement a random house generator upon input with the users name form. 

Target User: 
- Someone most likely to use this application would be a fan of the Harry Potter series. 
- The problem this solves is allowing users to have a fun experience seeing how they and their friends would be sorted in Hogwarts houses. 

Features:
- Users can input a name on the sorting form and generate a card with the name that was given and the randomized house they were assigned. 
- The student cards that are generated will display colors that correspond to the house that was assigned. 
- On the student cards there is a button that will allow users to expel a member of the students array and push the card to a voldemort array which will then be rendered on the DOM
